## Introduction

### What you will make

You will take an existing model trained to recognise lots of different kinds of images and retrain it to determine whether images show dogs or cats.The big advantage of this is that the model already knows how to identify interesting features of an image. You just need to remove the final layer, where it decides what classes those features match with, and train a new one of your own on data that only contains cats and dogs.

You will also create code to measure how well the model can do this, and to show how much you've improved on the original model in this task.

This project assumes you already know some Python. Specifically, it assumes you know how to use:

+ Variables
+ Lists
+ Functions, including creating your own function that accepts parameters

If you don't, you can learn all three by completing one of the following projects:

+ [Pride and Prejudice for zombies](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/pride-prejudice-zombies)
+ [Secret Agent Chat](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/secret-agent-chat)
+ [Deck of cards](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/deck-of-cards)

The project also assumes that you know the basics of how to interact with an image classifying model and get a prediction from it. If you don't, you can learn this in the [testing your compueter's vision project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/testing-vision).
