## Introduction

### What you will make

You will take an existing model trained to recognise lots of different kinds of images and retrain it to determine whether an image shows dogs or cats. The existing model already knows how to identify interesting features of an image. You will retrain the final layer of the model, which decides what those interesting features make up.

You will also measure how well the model can do this new job, and show how much you've improved on the original model in this task.

This project assumes you already know some Python. Specifically, it assumes you know how to use:

+ Variables
+ Lists
+ Functions, including creating your own function that accepts parameters

The project also assumes that you know the basics of how to interact with an image classifying model and get a prediction from it. If you don't, you can learn this in the ['Testing your computer's vision' project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/testing-vision).
